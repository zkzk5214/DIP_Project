Hit-or-Miss Transform  

Consider the image “RandomDisks-P10.jpg”. This binary- valued image considers WHITE to be background and BLACK to be foreground. It contains five sets of differently-sized solid black disks randomly scattered in the image. Each set of disks is characterized by a specific radius. The image is also corrupted by a 10% level of salt-and-pepper noise. This noise causes the disks to be corrupted by small cavities or very slightly corrupted outer borders.Note that the image is “almost” binary —  need to threshold it appropriately to convert it into a true binary-valued image for the task below.  

Design an appropriate hit-or-miss transform and a transform that detects the smallest and largest disks
