1. Write a MATLAB program to downsample the spatial resolution to 256×256, 128×128, and 32×32 pixels. 

2. Create an interpolated 512 × 512 image from your 32 × 32 image of part 1 (before you upsampled it to 512 × 512!) using either bilinear, bicubic, or inverse-distance interpolation, as discussed in G&W Sect. 2.4 and the Project Material document “Proj1-Interpolation.pdf.”
3. Write a program to change the gray-level quantization of the original 512×512 image by reducing the number of bits per pixel from 8 to 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 bits/pixel. Save these 7 new images. Be sure that the gray levels used in the new images span the 8-bit range! For example, for the new 6 bits/pixel image, the image pixels should use the 64 gray levels 0, 4, 8, 12, . . . 252.
4. Make a 512×512 image that: (i) changes the spatial resolution to 256 × 256 pixels and (ii) has 6 bits/pixel gray-scale resolution. Does this image depict any artifacts relative to the original high-resolution image?
5. Write a project report using the given project report template.
a. All methods should be described in addition to the structure of your code. b. All results should be presented and discussed.
c. Per the Computer Project Protocol, upload all required files to CANVAS.
