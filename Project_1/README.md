1. Write a MATLAB program to downsample the spatial resolution to 256×256, 128×128, and 32×32 pixels. 

2. Create an interpolated 512 × 512 image from 32 × 32 image of part 1 (before upsampled it to 512 × 512) using either bilinear, bicubic, or inverse-distance interpolation.

3. Write a program to change the gray-level quantization of the original 512×512 image by reducing the number of bits per pixel from 8 to 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 bits/pixel. 

4. Make a 512×512 image that: (i) changes the spatial resolution to 256 × 256 pixels and (ii) has 6 bits/pixel gray-scale resolution.
